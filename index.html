    <h1>Popup library</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever struggled to create a nice popup? There are many use cases for popups, and if
      you are a web developer you will most likely need to create one, but if you don't like styling
      or you simply don't know where to start, let me tell you you're in the right place.
    </p>
    <h2>Why this library?</h2>
    <p>
      You might be thinking, I can already use bootstrap or tailwind to display a popup, the thing
      is that if your project is not that big it might be unnecessary to add those CSS libraries to
      your project. Also some of this libraries don't let you customize things as you want, or it
      might be too difficult to do it. That's why I created this Popup library, exclusively to
      create popups.
    </p>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>If you use this library you'll be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create nice looking popups</li>
      <li>Easily customize all popup styles</li>
      <li>Handle popup buttons easily</li>
      <li>Write readable code</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Quick start</h2>
    <p>You have two options</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the Popup.js and popup.css files from the popup folder and add them to your project
        in the same path
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a link to the Popup.js file into the head tag of your html file or to the js file where
        you need to import it.
        <br /><br />
        Here's the link that you need to add:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <code> https://64b8a8082759da2db83182f8--popup-library.netlify.app/popup/popup.js </code>
    <p>
      The css file is necessary for the library to work, that's why is imported from the Popup.js
      file, so if you forget to download the popup.css file from the popup folder and add it to your
      project in the same path as the Popup.js file, it won't work.
    </p>
    <h2>Guide</h2>
    <p>Create an instance of the PopupManager class imported from the Popup.js file as shown:</p>
    <code>
      import PopupManager from "./popup/Popup.js"
      <br />
      <br />
      const ConfirmationPopup = new PopupManager(/* title, btnClose, styles */)
    </code>
    <p>
      As you saw when you create an instance of PopupManager you can (not mandatory) specify the
      popup: title, close button and styles. Title and close button parameters are inserted as HTML
      so you can send or not HTML code. The styles will be added as an attribute so you should send
      a string of valid css properties like this:
    </p>
    <code>
      const ConfirmationPopup = new PopupManager("Popup title", "close", "border: 2px solid gray;")
    </code>
    <p>
      However if you only create the instance it won't show anything, in order to do this let's take
      a look at the two most necessary methods from the PopupManager class:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>show(): Shows the created popup. It cannot be nested.</li>
      <li>close(): Hides the created popup. It cannot be nested.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course, if you use the show() method directly in the created instance it will show the
      popup once the webpage is loaded, which in most cases is not the intended beheavior, so you
      will need to handle this with a button click event like this:
    </p>
    <code>
      import PopupManager from './popup/Popup.js'
      <br />
      <br />
      const BasicPopup = new PopupManager('Basic popup', 'close', 'border: 2px solid gray;')
      document.getElementById('basic-popup').onclick = () => BasicPopup.show()
    </code>
    <p>
      Which will produce the following result (remember to create the button in the html with the id
      basic-popup):
    </p>
    <button id="basic-popup">Basic popup</button>
    <p>
      As you might've already realize the popup doesn't look too nice, that's because it's missing
      the content. Alongside the content let's take a look at some functions to change thing's we've
      already added like the title or close button:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        title(title: string): allows you to change the popup title, just as in the constructor it
        accepts a string that can be HTML code or not. Keep in mind that what you send as a
        parameter will be placed inside an h3 tag, so if you send HTML avoid using h tags. It can be
        nested.
      </li>
      <li>
        btnClose(btnClose: string): allows you to change the popup close button, just as in the
        constructor it accepts a string that can be HTML code or not. Keep in mind that what you
        send as a parameter will be placed inside a button tag, so if you send HTML avoid using
        button tags. It can be nested.
      </li>
      <li>
        style(styles: string): allows you to add custom styles to the popup, just as in the
        constructor it accepts a string with valid css properties separated by semicolons.
      </li>
      <li>
        content(content: string): allows you to insert or change the popup content. It is inserted
        as HTML so it accepts a string that may contain HTML tags. It can be nested.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's now change the popup content with the new methods that we've learned</p>
    <code>
      import PopupManager from './popup/Popup.js'
      <br />
      <br />
      const BasicPopup = new PopupManager('Basic popup', 'close', 'border: 2px solid gray;')
      document.getElementById('basic-popup').onclick = () => {
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;BasicPopup.content('&lt;p>This is HTML content with &lt;b>bold&lt;/b> and
      &lt;i>cursive&lt;/i> text.&lt;/p> ').show()
      <br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>Which will produce the following result:</p>
    <button id="basic-popup-content">Basic popup</button>
    <p>
      Now let's add something else to make this popup even more useful. We will add buttons to our
      popup. Let's create a new popup to delete a file:
    </p>
    <code>
      const btnClose = '&lt;span class="material-symbols-outlined">close&lt;/span>'
      <br />
      const DeleteFilePopup = new PopupManager('Delete file', btnClose)
      <br />
      const content = 'Are you sure you want to delete this file?'
      <br />
      DeleteFilePopup.content(content)
      <br />
      document.getElementById('delete-file').onclick = () => DeleteFilePopup.show()
    </code>
    <p>
      Now let's add the buttons but before, let's understand better how to add buttons to the popup:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        buttons(buttonObjects: buttonObject[], sharedHandler: function, position: 'left | center |
        right', sharedStyles: string): This method allows you to add buttons to the popup, buttons
        should be added as objects into the buttonObjects array, a buttonObject looks like this:
        <br />
        {
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;text: "The button content, it can be HTML or plain text",
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;handler: "The function that will handle the click event of the button",
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;type: "Can be 'confirm or error' this will only change the button styles",
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;style: "Allows you to set custom styles to each button"
        <br />
        }
        <br />
        So, if you want to add buttons simply create the objects of the buttons that you want to
        add, and send it as the first parameter of the buttons method, however, as you saw you have
        more parameters. So for instance, if you want to handle all the buttons event with a single
        function instead of setting one handler for each funtion, simply send this sharedFunction as
        a second parameter, this function receives 3 parameters, the event, the clicked button text
        and the button itself. After that you can set the buttons position being the options 'left |
        center | right' and lastly if there are some styles that all buttons shared send it as a
        fourth parameter of the buttons function instead of setting the same styles for each button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <code>
      // this is an icon from Google Icons
      <br />
      const btnClose = '&lt;span class="material-symbols-outlined">close&lt;/span>'
      <br />
      const DeleteFilePopup = new PopupManager('Delete file', btnClose)
      <br />
      const content = 'Are you sure you want to delete this file?'
      <br />
      const buttons = [
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;{
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text: 'Delete',
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type: 'error',
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handler: () => {
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Here you should have the logic to delete the file
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// for this example let's consider a timer as an async
      function
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setTimeout(() => {
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeleteFilePopup.content('File was deleted!')
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}, 3000) // after 3 seconds file will be deleted
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// while the file is being deleted you could display a
      message to your user
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeleteFilePopup.content('File is being deleted, please
      wait...').buttons()
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;},
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;{ text: 'Cancel', type: 'confirm', handler: () => DeleteFilePopup.close() }
      <br />
      ]
      <br />
      DeleteFilePopup.content(content).buttons(buttons)
      <br />
      document.getElementById('delete-file').onclick = () => DeleteFilePopup.show()
    </code>
    <p>Which will produce the following output:</p>
    <button id="delete-file">Delete file</button>
    <p>Now we're just missing 2 main things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        rollback(): all PopupManager instances have an initial state which is an object that saves
        the title, btnClose, content and buttons of the popup the first time they are set. So when
        you use the rollback method it will get the popup back to its initial state, which basically
        means that It will set all properties from the initial state object to the popup.
      </li>
      <li>
        options(options: optionsObject): the options parameter allows you to change some properties
        of the popup, all properties that can be change through the options method can be changed
        through an inidividual method, but we won't explore each of them, so is just for you to
        know. The optionsObject parameter looks like this:
        <br />
        {
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;allowSelect: boolean that allows the user to select content from the popup or
        not
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;preventExternalClose: boolean that prevents the user from closing the popup by
        clicking outside of it or not
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;position: 'top | center | bottom' sets the popup on one of the specified
        positions
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;maxWidth: number that specifies the amount of pixels that the popup will have as
        width
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;margin: string that will be set as a margin css property to the
        <br />
        }
      </li>
    </ul>

      Feel free to fork this repository and change modify it as you wish. There are other things
      that I left out because of time but you can explore the code so you discover more methods and
      functionalities.
